# How well are Sri Lankan websites archived?

## About this repository

This repository contains my forensic study on "How well are Sri Lankan websites archived?"

Inspiration drawn from Dr. Alkwai's study on ["How Well Are Arabic Websites Archived?"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2756406.2756912)

  * [Dataset](Files/dataset): Contains the Alexa top million sites, the filtered Sri Lankan sites and the nationsonline directory of Sri Lankan websites.
  * [Carbondate](Files/carbondate): Contains the code used to extract the carbondate and the output.
  * [Charts](Files/charts): Contains the charts I created and used in the presentation.
  * [Language Detection](Files/langdetect): Contains the code used to detect the language of the website, and the output.
