20221106024454 “First things first. Lifting weights is easy. If you think it’s hard or difficult or it makes you a tough guy, you’re a loser. Go get in the cage. Or train for it. And see what real work is. Lifting weights and sleeping is basically the same thing. Lay down. Easy.”
20221106024457 “First.I only lift 60/70 kilos maximum. I’ve benched 150/160kilo easily. Never tried for a max. But daily I play with this moderate weight. I like to lift 15 tons a day with my legs and with my arms. So. 15,000/60 = 250 reps.”
20221106024500 “So one day I’ll bench 60kilo 250 times. Then I’ll squat it. Done. Next day. I’ll shoulder press it. Then leg press it. Done. Etc. one upper body one legs exercise. Everyday.”
